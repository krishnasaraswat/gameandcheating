Good Bhishar and Smart Rishakh were playing a game. At their feet was Bhishar’s recent profit of a hundred gold shekels. 
The rules of their game were as follows. Rishakh would give Bhishar a random positive integer, who would then perform a neat little processing on the number:
if the number was odd, he would add to it, twice its value, and then throw in one more shekel for luck (for example, 13 would be replaced by 13+13*2+1 = 40). 
On the other hand, if the number was even, he would simply subtract half its value from it (for example, if the number was 14,  would be replaced by 7). 
He would go on repeating this until the number was reduced to just 1. 
For example, if you gave him the number 13, it would go like this: 13→40→20→10→5→16→8→4→2→1. 
We say that the “length” of this list of numbers is 9. Now, Bhishar was a nice guy, but rather poor at math. 
Each long round of computation would take him so much concentration and effort that Rishakh would quietly flick a  gold shekel from Bhishar’s bag by the time he was through. 
If Rishakh only knows numbers up to X, what is the maximum number of gold shekels he can flick from Bhishar?
